## Duckware: Source Code

ðŸ“‚ **This is the old source code of Duckware(segregation paste)**, my personal project in the realm of programming. Looking back at this code, I realize there are many things I regret: I was just starting to learn programming and, honestly, I didnâ€™t fully understand what I was doing. I made several mistakes, implemented systems inefficiently, and more. The reason Iâ€™m sharing this is that I want to avoid being asked repeatedly if I have the code for autowall, circle strafe, etc.

ðŸ”§ **In my current code** (not this one), Iâ€™ve added features such as glow (still in development), implemented no-spread for weapons that didnâ€™t have it, and added aimbot for shotguns, among other improvements. I want to thank a few people who have been of great help in my journey:

### Acknowledgements

ðŸŒŸ **Traitcore:** He taught me most of what I needed to know and explained every detail, even when he was busy. I appreciate it a lot; even though I donâ€™t know him personally, I feel like he was a sort of mentor to me. His patience and dedication have been invaluable in my learning.

ðŸ’– **Deniz:** He has provided constant emotional support and continues to be my anchor in this world. Despite having everything I could wish for, Iâ€™m not happy with my life at the moment. Additionally, Deniz helped me by explaining things and guiding me through the learning process. His support has been crucial for me.

ðŸ¤” **Noop:** I have mixed feelings about him. Heâ€™s a nice guy, at least he was with me, but speaking poorly of Deniz and Traitcore caused me to distance myself. I didnâ€™t plan to cut off the relationship until his friend started insulting me, and he did nothing to stop it, even blocking me for a while due to his friendâ€™s lies. Despite everything, I also thank him for teaching me a bit.
